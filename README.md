# Julio's resume

This is my updated 2016 resume, written in JSON, built with Gulp and rendered as HTML using [Pug](https://pugjs.org). It's meant to be print-friendly, mobile-friendly, screenreader-friendly and just friendly as a whole.

My previous resume was made in InDesign. As I honed my skills as a front-end engineer, I realized I could do better. I'd been dabbling in static site generation and I figured a resume would be a good proof of concept for the toolchain I had in mind.

The result was a meta-resume - a resume that can be read and printed as a document, as well as reviewed as code. Most of the build process is way overkill (who on earth would code unit tests around static HTML?) but hopefully it'll make a good boilerplate for more complex projects down the line.

## TODO

* Add a link to this repo in the footer (read it from package.json)
* Integrate with Travis
* Auto-publish to gh-pages
